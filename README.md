I am a web developer living in South Korea,<br/>

- Thinking about web development trends 📈
- Thinking about a better project architecture 🎨
- Thinking of analyzing traffic and using it as information 📋
- Worrying about security 🔒
- Contemplating whether or not to buy an Apple device 🍏
- What should I eat for lunch? 🍔
- I need to work out... 💪
